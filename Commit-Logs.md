# 2nd Commit - New Component

1. Creating new component using `ng g c component-name` cmd
2. Components that are used by AppComponent needs to be specified under declarations array field of AppModule to avoid compilation error
3. Components that are used by index.html needs to be specified under bootstrap array field of AppModule
